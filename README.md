# My First Python Project

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is my very first repository.

## Description
This project contains a Python script that generates a beautiful, colorful geometric pattern using the `turtle` library.

## How to run it:
1. Download the `magic_pattern.py` file.
2. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer.
3. Run the script and enjoy the animation!

*Created by me as I start my coding journey.*
## Demo
You can see the code running live here: [Live Python Demo](https://trinket.io/python/65bd99a383)
